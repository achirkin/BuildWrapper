Buildwrapper 0.6.1: release notes

Fixes:
	- dump GHC errors to std out when loading specific package
	- do not calculate usage on Setup.(l)hs as it can mess up loading since it's also a Main module
	- use extensions defined in OPTIONS pragma in outline
	
Enhancements:
	- error locations have exact span if available
